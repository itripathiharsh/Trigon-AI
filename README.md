# AI Operations Assistant (GenAI Multi-Agent System)

An intelligent, agentic system designed to handle complex user queries by orchestrating specialized tools. Built with a robust **Planner-Executor-Verifier** architecture, this assistant integrates real-time data from GitHub, Weather, News, and Media APIs to provide verified, high-quality responses.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+** installed.
* A virtual environment is recommended for dependency isolation.

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd ai_ops_assistant

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys (see `.env.example` for the template).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your keys

```

### 4. Running the Project

The application is built with **Streamlit** and can be launched with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py

```

## 🏗️ Architecture Explanation

This system utilizes an **Agentic Workflow** to ensure accuracy and prevent LLM hallucinations.

### 1. Planner Agent (The Brain)

* **Role**: Analyzes the user's natural language input.
* **Logic**: Breaks the request into a structured JSON execution plan (step-by-step tool calls).
* **LLM**: Powered by **Llama-3.3-70b (via Groq)** for high-reasoning planning.

### 2. Executor Agent (The Hands)

* **Role**: Executes the plan generated by the Planner.
* **Logic**: Routes tasks to the specific third-party APIs. It handles argument extraction and collects raw data from all integrated tools.

### 3. Verifier Agent (The Judge)

* **Role**: Audits the data returned by the Executor.
* **Logic**:
* **Success Path**: If data is valid, it formats it into a professional Markdown report.
* **Self-Correction Path**: If the tool data is empty or irrelevant, it generates a "Retry Instruction" and sends it back to the Planner to try a different approach.

## 🔌 Integrated APIs & Tools

| Tool | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LLM Engine** | Groq (Llama 3.3/3.1) | High-speed, structured text generation. |
| **Weather** | Open-Meteo | Real-time weather and geocoding (City to Lat/Long). |
| **News** | Currents API | Latest global headlines and keyword-based news search. |
| **GitHub** | PyGithub | Repository statistics, star counts, and tech trends. |
| **Media** | TMDB & Spotify | Movie details (Cast/Rating) and Music/Artist search. |

## 🧪 Example Prompts to Test

Try these prompts to see the Multi-Agent system in action:

1. **Multi-Tool Query**: *"Tell me the current weather in Lucknow and show me the latest news headlines about OpenAI."*
2. **Technical Search**: *"Find a popular GitHub repository for 'FastAPI' and give me its star count and description."*
3. **Entertainment Recommendation**: *"I'm feeling productive. Suggest 5 trending songs by Arijit Singh from Spotify."*
4. **Logical Comparison**: *"Which city is hotter right now, Mumbai or Delhi? Also, find a movie titled 'Inception' and list its top cast."*
5. **Complex Intent**: *"Search for news about 'GenAI' and find a Python GitHub repo that helps with LLM orchestration."*

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Tradeoffs

* **Rate Limits**: Since we are using free-tier API keys (Groq/Currents), sending 5+ rapid requests might trigger a 429 Rate Limit error.
* **Foursquare Deprecation**: The Foursquare Places API was deprecated in favor of a more stable manual data aggregation to ensure 100% uptime for the assignment demo.
* **Context Window**: To maintain speed, the Verifier only processes the top 5 news articles or search results at a time.
